    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Makes one pizza for four</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>For the dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g Tipo 00 flour</li>
        <li>350 cL water</li>
        <li>10g yeast (approximately one tablespoon)</li>
        <li>20g salt</li>
        <li>A little olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the base:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>250g tomatoes (mixed with a pinch of salt, a little olive oil, and basil or oregano)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p>
        First, mix 500g of Tipo 00 flour with 350 cL of water in a large bowl.<br> 
        Add 10g of yeast (approximately one tablespoon) and sprinkle in 20g of salt. <br>
        Drizzle in a little olive oil for flavor and texture. <br>
        Next, knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10-15 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. <br>
        Allow it to rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size. <br>
        Preheat your oven to the maximum temperature (ideally around 300°C / 572°F). <br>
        Punch down the risen dough to release any air bubbles, then shape it into a round or rectangular pizza base. <br>
        Mix 250g of tomatoes with a pinch of salt, a drizzle of olive oil, and some fresh basil or oregano, <br>
        and spread this tomato mixture evenly over the pizza base. Partially bake the base for 4-5 minutes to prevent a soggy crust. <br>
        After the initial bake, add 250g of mozzarella (or more, if you like it cheesy) and other toppings of your choice—ham, <br>
        spicy salami, tuna, anchovies, etc. Return the pizza to the oven and bake until the cheese is <br>
        melted, bubbly, and golden brown, and the crust is fully cooked. Slice your homemade pizza and savor the deliciousness! <br>
        Buon appetito!
