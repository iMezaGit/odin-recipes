First HTML project in The Odin Project.
-------
<p>My objective with The Odin Project is, ultimately, to gain a deeper understanding of how web pages work
in order to be better at Web Penetration testing and Bug Bounty, this way I can think like a Dev.</p>
<p>With this project I can practice what I've just learn about html:</p>
    * Basic HTML boilerplate and good practices
    * HTML text tags
    * HTML anchors and Links
    * HTML images
<p> In the future I will add CSS to make this page better </p>
