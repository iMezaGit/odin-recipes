First HTML project in The Odin Project.
-------
<p>My objective with The Odin Project is, ultimately, to gain a deeper understanding of how web pages work
in order to be better at Web Penetration testing and Bug Bounty, this way I can think like a Dev.</p>
<p>With this project I can practice what I've just learn about <strong>HTML</strong>:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Basic HTML boilerplate and good practices </li>
    <li> HTML text tags </li>
    <li> HTML anchors and Links </li>
    <li> HTML images </li>
</ul>
<p> In the future I will add CSS to make this page better </p>
